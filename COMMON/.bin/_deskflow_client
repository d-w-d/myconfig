## Description:
##   This script launches the Deskflow client (deskflow-client) within a Flatpak
##   sandbox to connect an Ubuntu machine (client) to a remote Deskflow server
##   running on a Mac at IP address 192.168.1.13. Deskflow enables sharing a
##   single keyboard and mouse across multiple computers over a network.
##
## Purpose:
##   The script ensures the Ubuntu client can be controlled from the Mac server
##   without requiring a local keyboard or mouse, even when no user is logged in.
##   It is designed to be executed automatically by GDM (GNOME Display Manager)
##   at the login screen to maintain connectivity after logout.
##
## Usage:
##   - Automatic: Integrated into /etc/gdm3/Init/Default to run at GDM startup.
##     No manual invocation required; use 'sudo systemctl restart gdm' to apply.
##   - Manual: Run '/usr/local/bin/deskflow-client.sh' from a terminal to test
##     the connection. Kill with 'flatpak kill org.deskflow.deskflow' or Ctrl+C
##     if testing interactively.
##
## Prerequisites:
##   - Deskflow must be installed via Flatpak (org.deskflow.deskflow).
##   - The Mac server at 192.168.1.13 must be running Deskflow in server mode.
##   - Network connectivity between the Ubuntu client and Mac server is required.
##
## Notes:
##   - The '--no-daemon' flag keeps deskflow-client in the foreground, suitable
##     for GDM integration when backgrounded with '&'.
##   - The '--enable-crypto' flag ensures encrypted communication with the server.
##   - If multiple instances run, use 'flatpak ps' and 'flatpak kill' to manage.
