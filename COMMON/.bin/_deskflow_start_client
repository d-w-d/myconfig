# Script Name: _deskflow_client (Simplified, Foreground)
# Purpose: Launches the Deskflow client Flatpak application in the foreground,
#          dynamically determining the target DISPLAY using the _find_display script.
# Usage:
#   - Ensure DESKFLOW_SERVER_IP environment variable is set.
#   - If targeting the login screen (DISPLAY :0), ensure _xauth_for_login_screen
#     has been run successfully in the current SSH session first.
#   - Run this script to start the client. It will occupy the terminal until stopped (Ctrl+C).
#   - Run again after graphical login (targeting DISPLAY :1 or similar) if needed.
# Dependencies:
#   - _find_display script (expected in same directory or PATH).
#   - DESKFLOW_SERVER_IP environment variable.
#   - org.deskflow.deskflow Flatpak installed.
# Style: Google Shell Style Guide compliant
